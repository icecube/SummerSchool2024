# Point Source Exercises
 These examples are designed to help you learn about how to conduct a point source search using IceCube Software.

# Using GitHub
 (Specific instructions for the exercises)
 
 GitHub is a way to track changes and edits to code, as well as to collaborate on a code.

To use this repository, you can clone it into a folder on your scratch directory:
```
mkdir summer_school-ps-demo
git clone https://github.com/jessiethw/summer_school_examples/tree/main/point_sources summer_school-ps-demo
```
You will then have your own copy of the code in a folder called summer_school-ps-demo. We will go through this example and answers in the Point Source Activity during Summer School. Try to complete the exercises without looking at the answers, until we go through the answers together.
